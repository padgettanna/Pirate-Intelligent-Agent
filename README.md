# Pirate Intelligent Agent

A reinforcement learning project featuring a pirate agent navigating an 8x8 maze to find a treasure. The project focuses on Q-learning with experience replay, allowing the agent to learn optimal paths from experience.

## My Contribution

I implemented the Q-learning experience replay module, which stores episodes, trains the agentâ€™s neural network, and allows the pirate to make decisions that maximize reward.

## Features

- Stores episodes (state, action, reward, next state, game status) for learning.
- Implements experience replay to train a neural network for pathfinding.
- Optimized agent navigation using Q-learning.
- Handles environment constraints such as blocked paths and revisited cells.
- Validates success using completion checks across all starting positions.
